#About Me
Vantez Alexander
Decatur Georgia
My interest in this field is learning how the computers communicate with each other and being apart of a forever growing industry.
Upon completing the cybersecurity course I aspire to land a network analsyst position and grow to be a senior network engineer.
A project that stood out to me is one where I had to become a mechanic for a day. My car needed a T-connector, which I purchased and replaced myself, and
this stood out because it was a time I needed help and had to rely on myself to get back and forth to work being that I had no mechanical experience.

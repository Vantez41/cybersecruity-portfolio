#About Me
Vantez Alexander
Decatur Georgia
My intrest in this field is learning how the computers communicate with each other and being apart of a forever growing industry
Upon completing the cybersecurity course i aspire to land a network analsyst position and grow to be a senior network engineer
A project that im proud of is one where i had to become a mechanic for a day. My car needed a t connector which i had boughtand replace myself 
this stood out because it was one of the times i needed help and had to rely on myself to get the job done to get back and forth to work having no mechanical experience
